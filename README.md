Hey there! I'm a researcher at Northeastern studying property-based testing. I've gotten pretty involved with developing [Hypothesis](https://github.com/hypothesisWorks/hypothesis/), a PBT library for python. I (intermittently) [blog about programming](https://tybug.github.io/).

I maintain a few small libraries:

* [circleguard](https://github.com/circleguard/circleguard)
* [circlecore](https://github.com/circleguard/circlecore)
* [circlevis](https://github.com/circleguard/circlevis)
* [ossapi](https://github.com/circleguard/ossapi)
* [snitchvis](https://github.com/tybug/snitchvis)
* [slider](https://github.com/llllllllll/slider)
* [osrparse](https://github.com/kszlim/osu-replay-parser)

And have moved on from a few others:
* [umdio](https://github.com/umdio/umdio)
* [planetterp](https://github.com/planetterp/planetterp)
