Hey there. I like writing helpful python libraries in my free time and putting them up on pypi. I also:

* am the author of [circleguard](https://github.com/circleguard/circleguard), a replay analysis program for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home), a rhythm game
* develop [planetterp](https://planetterp.com/), a ratemyprofessor-esque website specific to the Univeristy of Maryland
* develop [umdio](https://github.com/umdio/umdio), an api for the University of Maryland which consolidates many disparate data sources (courses and sections for each semester, bus routes, maps of campus) into a single place


#### Libraries

I'm the author of several libraries:

* [circlecore](https://github.com/circleguard/circlecore), a utilities library for osu!
* [circlevis](https://github.com/circleguard/circlevis), a (Py)Qt widget for visualizing osu! beatmaps and replays
* [ossapi](https://github.com/circleguard/ossapi), an osu! api wrapper

I maintain (but am not the original author of) a few more:

* [slider](https://github.com/llllllllll/slider), an osu! beatmap parser and utils library
* [osrparse](https://github.com/kszlim/osu-replay-parser), an osu! replay parser library
