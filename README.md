Hey there! I'm a researcher at Northeastern studying property-based testing. I've gotten quite heavily involved with developing [Hypothesis](https://github.com/hypothesisWorks/hypothesis/), a PBT library for python. I (occasionally) [blog about programming](https://tybug.github.io/).

In my free time, I maintain a few libraries / applications:

* [circleguard](https://github.com/circleguard/circleguard), a replay analysis program for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home), a rhythm game
* [circlecore](https://github.com/circleguard/circlecore), a utilities library for osu!
* [circlevis](https://github.com/circleguard/circlevis), a (Py)Qt widget for visualizing osu! beatmaps and replays
* [ossapi](https://github.com/circleguard/ossapi), an osu! api wrapper
* [snitchvis](https://github.com/tybug/snitchvis), to render videos of [snitch](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Snitch) events from [Civ](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page)-style minecraft servers
* [slider](https://github.com/llllllllll/slider), an osu! beatmap parser and utils library
* [osrparse](https://github.com/kszlim/osu-replay-parser), an osu! replay parser library
* [umdio](https://github.com/umdio/umdio), an api for the University of Maryland

Previously, I:
* developed [planetterp](https://github.com/planetterp/planetterp), a ratemyprofessor-esque website for the Univeristy of Maryland
