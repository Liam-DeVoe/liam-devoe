Hey there. I like writing helpful python libraries in my free time and putting them up on pypi. I also:

* am the author of [circleguard](https://github.com/circleguard/circleguard), a replay analysis program for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home), a rhythm game
* develop [planetterp](https://github.com/planetterp/planetterp), a ratemyprofessor-esque website specific to the Univeristy of Maryland
* develop [umdio](https://github.com/umdio/umdio), an api for the University of Maryland (courses, sections, professors, bus routes, maps of campus, etc)
* run [u/osureportbot](https://old.reddit.com/user/OsuReportBot) ([source](https://github.com/tybug/Osu-Reporter)), a bot to automate housekeeping tasks on [r/osureport](https://www.reddit.com/r/osureport)

I'm the author of several libraries:

* [circlecore](https://github.com/circleguard/circlecore), a utilities library for osu!
* [circlevis](https://github.com/circleguard/circlevis), a (Py)Qt widget for visualizing osu! beatmaps and replays
* [ossapi](https://github.com/circleguard/ossapi), an osu! api wrapper
* [snitchvis](https://github.com/tybug/snitchvis), a library to render videos of [snitch](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Snitch) events from [Civ](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page)-style minecraft servers

I maintain (but am not the original author of) a few more:

* [slider](https://github.com/llllllllll/slider), an osu! beatmap parser and utils library
* [osrparse](https://github.com/kszlim/osu-replay-parser), an osu! replay parser library

I (occasionally) blog about programming: https://tybug.github.io/
